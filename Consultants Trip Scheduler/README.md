# Consultants Trip Scheduler

**Problem Statement:**

The dataset contains the business trip schedules of the company's consultants, with each trip marked by Departure Date and Return Date. The objective is to identify overlapping trips for each consultant using color-coding. This involves determining when consultants have multiple trips that coincide and visually highlighting these overlaps to facilitate better scheduling and resource management. The goal is to optimize consultant availability and reduce scheduling conflicts.
